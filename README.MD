# Getting started with SJF and FCFS waiting turn around timer and also FIFO and LRU page fault counter
This program allows you to measure waiting and turn around time in the FCFS and the SJF algorithms, and also count the page faults of the FIFO and the LRU algorithms with randomized data created in `dataGenertator.js` file and exported to  `data/dataProc.txt` and `data/dataPage.txt`
## Staritng program
To lunch a program all you have to do is
1. Download `node.js`
2. Open directory named with algorithm that you are interested for
3. Compile the file
If you want to randomize the data or change the parameters of the data, and you have downloaded the `node.js` already:
1. Open the `dataGenerator.js`
2. Change the parameters in `Math.floor()` function
3. Compile the file.
