# Getting started with SJF and FCFS waiting turn around timer and also FIFO and LRU page fault counter
This program allows you to measure waiting and turn around time in the FCFS and the SJF algorithms, and also count the page faults of the FIFO and the LRU algorithms with randomized data created in `dataGenertator.js` file and exported to  `data/dataProc.txt` and `data/dataPage.txt`
## Staritng program
To lunch a program all you need to do is
1. Download `node.js`
2. Open the directory for the algorithm you want to test (SJF, FCFS, FIFO, or LRU)
3. Compile the file
</br>
If you want to randomize the data or change the parameters, you can do so by:

1. Opening the `dataGenerator.js`
2. Changing  the parameters in `Math.floor()` function
3. Compiling the file.
